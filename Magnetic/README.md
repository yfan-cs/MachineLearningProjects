This is the magnetic field data collected from the surface of a spinning ball of molten sodium designed to simulate the inner core of the earth in IREAP (next to AV Williams); it's called the Three Meter Experiment. The optimal autoencoding width of a chaotic physical system like this can be thought to represent the correct number of variables to model the system in, and the fact that this can be found quantitatively with no apriori knowledge is very profound.
